# Fudo Documentation

Fudo PAM is a complete solution for managing remote privileged access. Fudo PAM comprises four modules each dedicated to different aspects of remote access management:

- Privilege Session Monitoring (PSM)
- Secret Manager
- Efficiency Analyzer
- Application to Application Password Manager (AAPM)
- PSM

PSM module enables facilitating constant monitoring of remote access sessions to IT infrastructure. Fudo PAM acts as a proxy between users and monitored servers and it registers usersâ€™ actions, including mouse pointer moves, keystrokes and transferred files.

The PSM module records complete network traffic along with meta data, enabling precise session playback and full-text content search.

Fudo PAM enables viewing current connections and intervening in a monitored session in case the administrator notices a potential misuse of access rights.


The PSM module supports following system configurations:
- Linux,
- FreeBSD,
- Mac OS X
